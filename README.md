# Lisp Inference

A non-full featured Lisp Inference Engine because I didn't implemented
the reductor yet. The algorithm commonly used it's the [Wang
Algorithm], maybe can you help me?

# Usage

The main usage for now it's using as a truth-table generator by using
its command line interface. You can download the last release and use
as showed in the last picture as following:

```
ros install ryukinix/lisp-inference
~/.roswell/bin/inference
```

You need `ros` installed: [Roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell)
